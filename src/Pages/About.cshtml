					Services for .NET Foundation projects
				</h2>
				<p>
					The .NET Foundation provides several services to support the projects in our community. If you 're currently running a project along these lines, or if you 're interested in kicking off a new idea, please take a look at our New Project Checklist.
				</p>
				<h3>Management and administrative nitty-gritty</h3>
				<h4>Project guidance and mentoring</h4>
				<p>
					New projects joining us will get mentorship on how to best run an open source community along with access to developers currently seeking .NET projects. We work with project leads to help ensure the project grows into a vibrant and welcoming community. And of course, we love to share best practices for managing a friendly, collaborative, and innovative open source workplace, wherever you may be.
				</p>
				<h4>
					IP and legal
				</h4>
				<p>
					Legal can be tricky. We can help. Projects in our organization will get assistance to organize and manage their IP assignments as well as infrastructure for tracking common, simple, Contribution License Agreements across all .NET Foundation projects. We can also help ensure that your collaborators respect the open source licenses and trademarks of projects assigned to the .NET Foundation. Need advice on legal issues? We offer support there as well.
				</p>
				<h4>
					Marketing and communications
				</h4>
				<p>
					The more people who know about .NET, the better for the ecosystem. We work with Microsoft and other industry leaders to improve your project 's exposure within the community at large. Your success is our success-we'd love to see you achieve the accolades you deserve!
				</p>

				<h4>
					Financial support
				</h4>
				<p>
					While we do not provide grants or funding for projects, we can help you accept, invoice, and process in-kind donations or those earmarked for donation on behalf of the individual projects. As a U.S. tax-exempt non-profit organization (501.(c)(6)), there are some limits to what we can do to support you from a financial perspective, but let's make sure your funds are spent and allocated appropriately.
					When running events such as meet-ups and conferences, the foundation can also work with projects to create ticket selling accounts, arrange contracts with venues, and more to make sure you have what you need. Donations typically cover relevant activities including hosting expenses, travel expenses, promotional items, sponsorships, and more.

							<h4>
								General services
							</h4>
							<p>
								We provide support services for our projects including Authenticode code-signing of binaries and installers, binary distribution management, forums, hosting, shared secret storage, online and phone conferencing as well as document collaboration facilities and access to software.
							</p>
							<h4>
								CLA management
							</h4>
							<p>
								Our automated CLA system has been working well for GitHub-based projects, with a very high rate of developers able to easily sign their Contribution License Agreements electronically. This service is offered with full automated notification to the project committers regarding the CLA status of a pull request author.
							</p>
							<h4>
								Secret management
							</h4>
							<p>
								Get a secure vault to store secrets related to your project (social media credentials, website logins, etc.). Share credentials securely between trusted maintainers on your project, or simply enjoy the peace of mind that they're safely saved.
							</p>
							<h4>
								SSL certificates
							</h4>
							<p>
								We've partnered with DigiCert to provide SSL certificates for the .NET Foundation OU. We set your project up in Digicert's system, you request the certificate for your website, and they're paid for centrally by the foundation.
							</p>
							<h4>
								Code signing
							</h4>
							<p>
								We've implemented an automated service to Authenticode signing your release MSIs, EXEs and Nuget Packages with the .NET Foundation code signing certificate. The certificate is well known to Windows Smart Screen, so people can install your open-source application without warnings. It also allows for consuming applications knowing that the binary downloaded is the one created on your build server.
							</p>
							<h4>
								Hosting
							</h4>
							<p>
								We provide hosting for a number of .NET Foundation project resources in Microsoft Azure. We have a .NET Foundation Office 365 account with SharePoint Online, Exchange, and more.

							<h4>
								Software
							</h4>
							<p>
								If your maintainers need access to certain software to enable them to work more effectively on their open source projects, contact us and we can talk with vendors on your behalf. Microsoft has sponsored a number of MSDN subscriptions for .NET Foundation project contributors over the past 12 months.
							</p>
							<h4>
								Forums
							</h4>
							<p>
								We use Discourse for our forums, and we can also set up dedicated, project-specific forums if your project will benefit from it.
							</p>
							<h4>
								AppVeyor
							</h4>
							<p>
								The .NET Foundation has a Professional FOSS subscription with AppVeyor, which allows projects to access the latest version of Visual Studio and the fastest category of build servers.
							</p>
							<h4>
								MyGet
							</h4>
							<p>
								If you want to have a NuGet feed for your project's CI builds, we have a dedicated MyGet enterprise instance (dotnet.myget.org) with enhanced storage capabilities.
							</p>
							<h4>
								Domain and DNS registration
							</h4>
							<p>
								Just let us know if you'd like the .NET Foundation to safeguard your project domain names or assist with DNS configuration.
							</p>
							<h4>

				<h2 id="frequent-questions">
					Other questions that come up
				</h2>
				<h3>
					Why create the .NET Foundation?
				</h3>
				<p>
					We were designed from the start as an independent forum to foster open development and collaboration across open source technologies for .NET. Our goal is to strengthen the .NET ecosystem through openness, rapid innovation, and community participation. If you get involved, we'll help you stay focused on producing high-quality software without the legal and administrative distractions and overhead. Keep your eye on the code and your users!
				</p>
				<h3>
					Why not encourage .NET open source projects to join other foundations?
				</h3>
				<p>
					We certainly don't discourage it! Absolutely feel free to join any foundation you prefer. We will even happily facilitate those connections when we can.
					We are special in that we're the only foundation to focus exclusively on .NET.  That means we can keep our focus narrow, and that our community shares the same skills, tools, and environments-so it's a good filter to know what you're getting.
				</p>
				<h3>
					What license will .NET Foundation projects use?
				</h3>
				<p>
					The .NET Foundation is license-agnostic. Projects that come to the Foundation are free to choose any open source license, as defined by the Open Source Initiative.
					However, we do NOT believe that making software available under an open source license is sufficient. We expect our projects to accept contributions from the community where they clearly align with the project strategy.
				</p>
				<h3>
					How are .NET Foundation projects governed?
				</h3>
				<p>
					It's incredibly important to have a clear governance model that describes how individuals and organizations can engage with a project. This ensures transparency, which is fundamental to our beliefs. The .NET Foundation does not prescribe a governance model for projects. However, we do work with project leads to ensure that they define and document an optimal model that matches the community's objectives.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Will the Foundation influence which projects are accepted?
				</h3>
				<p>
					All .NET Foundation projects are expected to contribute to the .NET ecosystem in some direct way.
					<ul>
						<li>
							Initial evaluation of community health
						</li>
						<li>
							Needs to be directly .NET related
						</li>
						<li>
							Otherwise, anything goes!
						</li>
					</ul>

					Corporate Sponsors
				</h2>
				<p>
					We're inviting the .NET community to take an active role in guiding and supporting the .NET Foundation, and that includes both individual open source developers and businesses that depend on .NET open source. We think it's really important to involve corporate sponsors as a key part of this change for three reasons.
				</p>
				<p>
					First, for the .NET Foundation to really be independent and community run, it needs to be independently funded. In the past, we've depended on (greatly appreciated!) donations from Microsoft. Going forward, we'll be funded by Corporate Sponsorships and Member Dues. Microsoft's donation as a Corporate Sponsor will now be a relatively small percentage of our funding.
				</p>
				<p>
					Secondly, Corporate Sponsorship really expands what the .NET Foundation can do - not just by having a bigger budget, but by being able to make long term plans based on annual dues payments.
				</p>
				<p>
					Third, Corporate Sponsorship directly involves the .NET corporate world in the .NET open source ecosystem, which is important! We'll have input from companies that depend on .NET open source, we'll be able to tackle some hard problems like how companies can be involved in sustainable community run open source projects.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you're interested in learning more about the sponsorship program, get in touch: contact@dotnetfoundation.org
